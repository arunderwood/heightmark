/**
 * The tracking session's domain policy: which GNSS fixes are worth averaging,
 * and what the number on screen is currently worth.
 *
 * Owns the [ElevationService] window together with the flags that describe it
 * — first fix seen, duty-cycle idleness, the post-flush wait for a fresh fix,
 * the last value shown and the [ElevationDatum] it was measured against — so a
 * flush and the state explaining it can never drift apart.
 *
 * The number on screen is built from three parts:
 *  - The window: the current GPS session's fixes, from radio-on to radio-off.
 *  - The [pool]: every earlier session folded into one [HeightEstimate] by
 *    [SessionPool]. A phone's GNSS height carries a bias of about 5 m that
 *    lasts minutes, so each session settles somewhere new. Pooling sessions
 *    instead of replacing one with the next is what stops a still phone's
 *    reading from jumping by that bias at every wake.
 *  - The [odometer]: height carried up or down since tracking began, from
 *    the barometer, with weather left out. Window and pool hold heights
 *    minus the odometer reading at the time, so a fix taken two floors down
 *    still measures the same thing as one taken here, and the screen follows
 *    a climb at once instead of waiting for GNSS to notice. On a device
 *    without a barometer the odometer stays at zero.
 *
 * A session is folded into the pool when it ends (the radio restarts after a
 * wake, a long background gap or a block) and every [FOLD_INTERVAL_NANOS]
 * while it runs, since windows that far apart carry nearly independent errors.
 *
 * Following [DetailsPanelPresenter], the clock is an input rather than a
 * [android.os.SystemClock] call, so the whole policy stays assertable in a JVM
 * test. Nothing here touches a Context or a view: [ElevationTracker] keeps the
 * listener registration and the coroutines, and [ElevationFragment] the
 * rendering.
 *
 * Confined to the main thread — GNSS callbacks, barometer samples and the
 * geoid-conversion coroutine all land there — so none of the state is
 * synchronized.
