/**
 * Runs a slow conversion over a stream of items one at a time, in the order
 * they arrive, and hands each result to [deliver].
 *
 * One consumer coroutine drains the inbox, so two conversions never overlap and
 * results never reorder. A lock inside [convert] could not give that guarantee:
 * a JVM monitor does not wake its waiters first-come-first-served.
 *
 * The inbox keeps only the newest unconverted item. While a conversion runs,
 * each arrival replaces the one before it, because for a stream of readings the
 * newest supersedes the rest and a backlog would only delay it. Once
 * conversions are fast nothing is ever waiting, so nothing is dropped.
 *
 * [convert] may switch dispatchers; [deliver] always runs in the coroutine
 * [start] launched, so a caller that starts it on the main thread can keep
 * everything it mutates there. Not thread-safe: [start], [submit] and [stop]
 * belong to one thread.
